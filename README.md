## Notes

A challenge I had while building the project was that I couldn't figure out how to make it so that when the Add Note button is pressed, it navigates to the EditNote Fragment and actually saves the data when Save button is pressed. Currently it just creates a new Note on the main screen, which the user can click on to edit.
